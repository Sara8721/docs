# Overview

Liquid staking is a way to allow users to stake their token and earn rewards while still having access to their assets. Traditional staking locks up users' assets, making them inaccessible. Liquid staking allows users to keep using their assets by staking them to a protocol using smart contracts and converting their staked assets into liquid tokens.

Liquid staking has the following benefits:
- Users can earn staking rewards while still having access to their assets.
- Users can participate in DeFi protocols using liquid tokens.
- Users can reduce their staking risk.
