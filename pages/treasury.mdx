# DAO Treasury

## Overview

The FIS token of StaFi is currently fully unlocked and in circulation. However, the details regarding the allocation of tokens for the community and inflation have not been previously explained. This proposal aims to address the treasury situation concerning the community and inflation components. It will provide an overview of the addresses associated with these two parts and propose partial staking of the treasury, as well as introducing burning mechanisms in the future to ensure long-term sustainability.

StaFi is actively undergoing decentralization, aiming to become a permissionless, contributor-driven DAO. In order to enhance transparency and promote long-term sustainability, we are releasing the details of the community aspect of the DAO Treasury, includes both the Inflation Treasury and the Community Treasury allocated from Genesis Sumup, and all the FIS tokens have been unlocked and are in circulation.
