## What is SIP

StaFi Improvement Proposals (SIP) describe standards for the core protocol specifications, contract standards and client APIs.They are standardized documents voted upon by StaFi Governance. SIPs can be added, amended, replaced, and removed.

The Core Principles provide important guidelines that SIP authors should follow when writing SIPs. These principles are crucial to ensuring that SIPs are effective and useful.

- **Specific**: A SIP must define and address a specific behavior or single responsibility. Overburdened SIPs are not allowed.
- **Completeness**: SIPs must be thorough and cover all relevant details. Specifics should not be left undefined or unreferenced.
- **Avoid Overlap**: Multiple SIPs should not implement the same behavior independently, as this can lead to confusion and inefficiency. For example, there should not be two separate and interchangeable ways to onboard collaterals.
- **Brevity**: SIPs should be as concise as possible while still including all essential information. This ensures that SIPs are easy to read and understand, and that they do not contain unnecessary or redundant information.

## SIP Lifecycle

The SIP (StaFi Improvement Proposal) lifecycle consists of several phases that ensure community input and consensus before implementation.

- **Conception**: a SIP Author proposes a new SIP in the StaFi forum under the Proposal category and adds the Discussion Draft tag.
- **Request for Comments(RFC):** A period of reviewing by the community and attendant redrafting begins. The minimum duration of this period is one week.
- **Fulfilled Feedback Period Requirements:** After the SIP has fulfilled the RFC phase, it is ready for Formal Submission.
- **Formal Submission:** Once the SIP has successfully fulfilled the feedback requirements of the RFC phase, it moves on to Formal Submission. The SIP Author submits the proposal in the StaFi forum under the Proposal category and adds the [SIP-x] tag.
- **Off-chain Vote**: The SIP is published on the OpenSquare for rFIS holders to vote on. The minimum duration of voting is one week.The type of voting is single choice.
- **Accepted/Rejected:** The SIP is voted on. If it passes, it is officially accepted and is given the `Accepted` status. If not, the SIP is rejected.****
