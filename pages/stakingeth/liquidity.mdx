# Liquidity Mining

Liquidity mining is a program that incentivizes users to provide liquidity to the StaFi protocol. By providing liquidity, users can earn rewards in the form of StaFi tokens (FIS). The program is designed to encourage users to contribute to the liquidity of the rETH, which is essential for its success.

rETH Liquidity Mining Pools enable users to add their rETH to contribute to the rETH liquidity while earning additional yield from their staked tokens. With StaFi's rETH, participants can stake their ETH and rETH in these pools and in return, receive rewards depending on the pool they are on. Rewards are generated from the trading feeâ€™s that occur from swaps as well as further incentivizations from StaFi and 3rd party protocols.
