## The rBNB Token

The following are the addresses where rMATIC has been issued on different chains:

- BSC: [0xf027e525d491ef6ffcc478555fbb3cfabb3406a6](https://bscscan.com/address/0xf027e525d491ef6ffcc478555fbb3cfabb3406a6)

Additionally, rBNB holders can participate in liquidity mining. To learn more about this opportunity, please [visit this page](https://app.stafi.io/rpool?program=lp).

## Commission Fee

10% of MATIC staking rewards will be allocated to StaFi DAO and validator.
