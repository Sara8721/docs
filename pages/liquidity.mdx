## StaFi Hub

This guide takes rATOM/ATOM pair as an example to demonstrate how to add liquidity, remove liquidity and swap between rToken and original token (StaFiHub chain). The rTokens should be on the StaFiHub chain.

Before testing, please make sure that you have installed Keplr wallet. If not, please download/install and follow the instructions to import your StaFi account. 

### Transfer Tokens From CosmosHub to StaFiHub

Before trading on rDEX V2, please make sure that your tokens are on StaFiHub chain. If not, please swap your tokens from CosmosHub to StaFiHub. For now, there are 2 ways for it: 
- rBridge Swap(IBC) on StaFiHub rToken App: https://app.stafihub.io/rBridge
- IBC transfer on Kelpr wallet

Similarly, if you want to swap tokens from StaFiHub to CosmosHub, these two ways are also applicable.

<Callout type="info">
The receiving address added in the progress must be StaFiHub address, and it should be the same one as rATOM address for the convenience of adding liquidity on rDEX.
