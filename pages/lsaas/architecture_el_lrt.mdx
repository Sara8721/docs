title: LRT Stack
---

StaFi LRT Stack is a simple, scalable and open-source development stack that powers EigenLayer LRT providers. Developers can launch a LRT based on it. 

## Smart contracts

- LrdToken: an ERC-20 compatible derived token. Users receive this token as a receipt for staking LST. And it will be burnt after unstaking.
- StakePool: do delegation stuff with EigenLayer and will be bound to the chosen operator.
- StakeManager: keep track of pools' states, interact with restakers, and do other routine works

## Stakers flows

### Stake Flow

Users can stake ETH directly or any LSTs. For ETH stakers, they should call StakeManager.`stakeETH` with the amount of ETH they are willing to stake. For LST stakers, they should call StakeManager.`stake` with LST token and the amount of the token. They will receive LRT in return no matter which LST or ETH they deposited.

- Scenario 1: Staking LST

- Scenario 2: Staking ETH

### Unstake & Withdraw Flow
Any LRT holders are valid users, and can unstake their tokens in exchange for LSTs. 
- Firstly, choose which pool supported LSTs they are willing to receive.
- Secondly, approve StakeManager to spend their LRT tokens.
- Thirdly, call StakeManager.unstake method with selected LSTs.
- Lastly, call StakeManager.withdraw to claim their LSTs after unbonding period.

## Relay Service

Due to the limitation of smart contract, it could not launch an execution. So StaFi LRT Stack introduces Relay service. It will trigger StakeManager, at a certain interval, to collect and calculate users' reward, distribute it to the project and users.
