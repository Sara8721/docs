# How to deploy an EVM LSD stack

This guide provides a step-by-step script to deploy an EVM LSD project, without deep understanding of contracts and services. Read the documentation for comprehensive understandings of these components.

## Step1. Deploy your LSD network contracts

61 Lab have made [StaFi LSaaS](https://stack-app.stafi.io/) for project parties to deploy their LSD network contracts.

## Why LSD Token could not be changed?

As being the heart of the LSD network, LSD token must be stable, reliable and trustable. Users hold LSD Token as a receipt of staking so it could not be changed.

## Which Token Type should I choose?

Standard LSD Token:
- Provided by StaFi Stack
- ERC-20 compatible
- Ready to use

Several Procedures required before using Custom LSD Token:
1. Implement your own LST logic which comply with [Stack's standards](TBD: definition of LSD Token Standards).
2. Deploy your contract
3. For security reason, please request 61Lab for whitelisting your token 

## Parameter Tips

Owner Address: sets the owner of the LSD network being created.

Owner Permissions:
- Upgrade contracts
- Adjust commission fee
- Adjust duration of era
- Nominate voter manager
- Adjust parameters

Validator Number:
- How many validators you intend to set
- Highly recommend to set more than 1
- The more validators you set the more decentralized advantages the network gets
- Browse all Sei active validators on [Testnet](https://seitrace.com/validators?chain=atlantic-2) or [Mainnet](https://seitrace.com/validators?chain=pacific-1)
- Browse all BNB Smart Chain active validators on [Testnet](https://testnet-staking.bnbchain.org/en/bnb-staking) or [Mainnet](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bnb-staking)
- Browse all Polygon active validators on [Validator list](https://staking.polygon.technology/validators), make sure you select the correct network: mainnet or testnet

## Rewards Distribution

Rewards distribution is crucial to project parties. Commission fee of users is set default as 10% and StaFi Stack fee is 10% of the project income. for example, if `100Token` rewards received from the chain, the distribution will be:

| Role | Amount(Token) | Formula |
|---------------|--------|-------|
|  Users        |  90 | 100*(1-0.1)  |
|  Project      |  9  | (100-90)*(1-0.1)  |
|  StaFi Stack  |  1  | 100-90-9  |

## Save all the information generated

The LSD network has a set of smart contracts, so you should save all the information which you will interact frequently with, such as LSD App, and Relay service.

- LSD Network Factory address
- Owner address
- LSD Token address
- Stake Manager address
- Stake Pool address
- Validators address

## Step2. Run relay service
[Follow this doc to run relay service](relay.html)

## Step3. Deploy your own LSD App
