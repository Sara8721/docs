## Ton Contracts

Smart contracts form the core of the TON LSD Stack. The system comprises several key contracts, each serving a specific purpose in the liquid staking ecosystem. Here's an overview of the main contracts:

### StakePool

The StakePool contract manages individual liquid staking pools. Each pool represents a project party and handles staking, unstaking, and reward distribution.

Key functions:
- `stake`: Allows users to stake TON coins and receive LSD tokens
- `request_loan`: Validators(borrowers) can request loans for staking
- `allocate_loan`: Allocates loans to validators
- `update_round`: Updates the round status and handles data changes
- `finish_loan`: Completes the loan process and distributes rewards

### StakePod

StakePod contracts are created for each validator participating in the system. They manage the interaction between validators and the Elector contract.

Key functions:
- `proxy_new_stake`: Proxies new stake requests to the Elector
- `proxy_recover_stake`: Recovers stakes from the Elector

### LsdTokenMaster

The LsdTokenMaster contract manages the issuance and overall supply of LSD tokens.

Key functions:
- `proxy_mint_tokens`: Mints new LSD tokens
- `proxy_request_unstake`: Handles unstaking requests
- `proxy_request_withdraw`: Processes withdrawal requests

### LsdTokenWallet

LsdTokenWallet contracts represent individual user wallets for LSD tokens.

Key functions:
- `send_tokens`: Sends LSD tokens to another address
- `receive_tokens`: Receives LSD tokens
- `unstake`: Initiates the unstaking process
- `withdraw`: Withdraws unstaked TON coins

## System Characteristics

- **Permissionless Operations**: Many key operations, such as starting new rounds and allocating loans, are permissionless. This design enhances the decentralized nature of the TON LSD Stack.

- **Round-based Processing**: The system operates in rounds, with each round having different statuses (Open, Allocating, Allocated, Staking, Held, Finishing, Finished). This structure ensures orderly processing of stakes, loans, and rewards.

- **Flexible Commission Structure**: The system supports configurable commission rates for both the platform and the stack, allowing for adaptable fee structures.

- **Validator Management**: The system includes mechanisms for adding, removing, and updating validators, providing flexibility in managing the validator set.

This contract structure allows for a comprehensive, flexible, and secure liquid staking system on the TON blockchain, catering to various participants including stakers, validators, and project administrators.
