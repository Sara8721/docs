TON LSD Stack is designed to help developers build liquid staking projects and provides a comprehensive set of solutions related to commission fee management, validator set management, and user operations: stake, unstake, withdraw.

## Contracts

Through the contracts, project parties can create stake pool and related accounts. These accounts are essential for an LSD project that records all the states of the project, such as: selected validator set, the rate between LSD and TON, and commission fee etc. They are also dependencies for the Relay service and LSD dApp.

## LSD Relay Service

The Relay Service is a crucial off-chain component of the TON LSD Stack. It interacts with the on-chain smart contracts to facilitate various operations in the liquid staking system. This service is responsible for monitoring and triggering key processes in the stake pools.

## LSD dApp

Once the LSD accounts are created, you can deploy the LSD dApp for users to stake, unstake, withdraw and get the latest information about the project party.
