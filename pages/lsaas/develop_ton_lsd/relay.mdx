title: Relay
---

The Relay Service is a crucial off-chain component of the TON LSD Stack. It interacts with the on-chain smart contracts to facilitate various operations in the liquid staking system. This service is responsible for monitoring and triggering key processes in the stake pools.

## Key Features

1. Continuous Monitoring: The relay service runs continuously, checking the state of stake pools at regular intervals (every 30 seconds).
2. Round Management: It manages different stages of staking rounds, including allocation, updating, and finishing.
3. Smart Contract Interaction: The service sends external messages to the stake pool smart contract to trigger various operations.

## Main Operations

The relay service performs three primary operations based on the current round status:

1. Allocate Loan (opAllocateLoan):

Triggered when a round is in "Open" or "Allocating" status.
Initiates the loan allocation process for validators.


2. Update Round (opUpdateRound):

Executed when a round is in "Allocated" or "Staking" status.
Updates the round information when the validator set has changed.


3. Finish Loan (opFinishLoan):

Activated when a round is in "Held" or "Finishing" status and the stake holding period has ended.
Completes the loan process and handles reward distribution.


## Technical Details

1. Connection: Uses liteclient to establish a connection with the TON network.
2. Smart Contract Interaction: Utilizes the tonutils-go library for sending external messages to smart contracts.
3. State Monitoring: Regularly checks the stake pool state and blockchain configuration.

## Configuration
The relay service requires two main configuration parameters:

* stakePool: The address of the stake pool contract.
* globalConfigUrl: The URL for the TON network configuration.
