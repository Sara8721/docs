Cosmos LSD Stack is devoted to help developers building liquid staking project in Cosmos ecosystem, and designed to provide a comprehensive set of solutions related to Cosmos LSM, CosmWasm, commission fee management, validator set management, and user operations: stake, unstake, withdraw.

Given the complexity of Cosmos ecosystem, StaFi Cosmos LSD Stack supports most chains that either adhere to the [ICS-27 Interchain Protocol](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/app/ics-027-interchain-accounts) or [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com). However, it is not compatible with a few chains, such as Irisnet(IRIS), which do not support either.

1. Our Stack can be directly deploy on the target chains if they support CosmWasm
2. Conversely, for ICS-27 Protocol chains, Our Stack deploys on [Neutron](https://www.neutron.org/), which is a permissionless smart contract platform, and gives programmable operations of ICA and ICQ on the target chain

The Stack current development progress:
- Ready to use for ICS-27 protocol chains
- Smart contracts for CosmWasm native chains are under development, stay tuned
