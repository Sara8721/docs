title: Deploy a LRT project
---

This guide provides a step-by-step script to deploy a LRT project through StaFi LRT Stack, without knowing details about contracts and services. Read the documentation for comprehensive understandings of these components.

## Step1. Deploy your LRT network contacts

61 Lab have made [StaFi LSAAS platform](https://stack-app.stafi.io/) for project parties to deploy their LRT network contracts.

### Parameter Tips

Owner Address: sets the owner of the LRT network being created.

Owner Permissions:
- Upgrade contracts
- Adjust commission fee
- Adjust duration of era
- Manage supported LSTs

Operator Address:
- Must be registered operator on EigenLayer
- Go and find operator on [Holesky Operator list](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/operator) or [Mainnet Operator list](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/operator) depending on the network you want to deploy to

### Which Token Type should I choose?

Standard LRD Token:
- Provided by StaFi Stack
- ERC-20 compatible
- Ready to use

Several Procedures required before using Custom LRT:
1. Implement your own LRT logic which comply with Stack's standards.
2. Deploy your contract
3. Request StaFi Stack Team for whitelisting your token for security reason

### Why LRD Token could not be changed?
As being the heart of the LRT network, LRD token must be stable, reliable and trustable. Users hold LRD Token as a receipt of staking so it could not be changed.

### Rewards Distribution

Rewards distribution is crucial to project parties. Commission fee of users is set default as 10% and StaFi Stack fee is 10% of project income. for example, if `100ETH` rewards received from EigenLayer, the distribution will be:

| Role | Amount | Formula |
|---------------|--------|-------|
|  Users        |  90ETH | 100ETH*(1-0.1)  |
|  Project      |  9ETH  | (100ETH-90ETH)*(1-0.1)  |
|  StaFi Stack  |  1ETH  | 100ETH-90ETH-9ETH  |

### Save all the information generated

The lrd network has a set of smart contracts, so you should save all the information which you will interact frequently with, such as building your staking app, and running relay service.

- LRD Factory address
- Owner address
- Operator address
- LRT address
- Stake Pool address
- Stake Manager address
