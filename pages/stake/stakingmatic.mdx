# Staking POL(ex-MATIC) with StaFi

<Callout type="info">
On September 4th, MATIC will transition to POL. In the initial phase, POL will replace MATIC as the native gas and staking token for Polygon PoS, with subsequent phases expanding POL’s role in the AggLayer. For more information, please refer to this [post](https://x.com/0xPolygon/status/1717134336104038580?s=20).

Notes regarding the Polygon network upgrade from MATIC to POL

- rMATIC holders on StaFi rToken App don't need to take any action.
- Please make sure that you have completed the upgrade for the MATIC on Ethereum to POL before staking via StaFi rToken App.
