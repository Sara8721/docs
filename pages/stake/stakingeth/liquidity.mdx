title: Liquidity Mining
---

Liquidity mining is a program that incentivizes users to provide liquidity to the StaFi protocol. By providing liquidity, users can earn rewards in the form of StaFi tokens (FIS). The program is designed to encourage users to contribute to the liquidity of the rETH, which is essential for its success.

## Mint Program

The Mint Program is a staking incentive program that rewards users for staking their tokens in StaFi and minting new rTokens.

When users stake their tokens in StaFi, they receive rTokens, which represent their staked tokens. They also receive FIS rewards, which are paid out in proportion to their stake.

Guides:
- Click the following link to enter the [Pool page](https://app.stafi.io/pool/all). This guide takes the rETH pool as an example to demonstrate the main functions.
- Click "Mint" to stake ETH, the page will jump to ETH staking page, then stake ETH as the page prompt.
- After the staking is completed, the page will be displayed on the details page. Then click "Claim" to claim FIS rewards.

There is also another type of rToken program, which is called Liquidity Mining. In Liquidity Mining, users stake their rTokens to a liquidity mining contract. Their rTokens are locked, and they will receive FIS rewards in return.

The Mint Program and rToken Liquidity Mining are both designed to incentivize users to stake their tokens in StaFi and earn rewards. By staking their tokens, users can earn both rTokens and FIS rewards.

- Click "Deposit" to stake rETH, and wait for claim FIS rewards.

## DeFi Integration

rETH Liquidity Mining Pools enable users to add their rETH to contribute to the rETH liquidity while earning additional yield from their staked tokens. With StaFi's rETH, participants can stake their ETH and rETH in these pools and in return, receive rewards depending on the pool they are on. Rewards are generated from the trading feeâ€™s that occur from swaps as well as further incentivizations from StaFi and 3rd party protocols.
