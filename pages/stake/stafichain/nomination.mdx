## More to Know

### Stash and Controller

The Stash account and Controller account can be the same account, however, for security concerns, it is recommended to set 2 different accounts respectively.

<Callout type="info">
Note: When the Stash account and the Controller account are set to different accounts, the Controller account balance cannot be 0, and a small amount of FIS must be sent to the Controller account in advance as a fee for the nomination cost. Otherwise the nomination transaction will fail.
</Callout>

### When does nomination take effect

If you nominate validators during the first 45 minutes of 5th Epoch in a Era, and the nominated validators has been listed by the `(N+1)th Era`, then the rewards will be generated at the `(N+1)th Era`, while reward can be claimed at `(N+1+1)th Era`.

In the Last 15 minutes of the 5th Epoch in the `Nth Era`, all data will be freezed temporarily. Nominations are not allowed during this period.

If you nominate validator during the 6th Epoch of the `Nth Er`a, all validators of the `(N+1)th Era` have already been elected, so your nomination and rewards will not take effect until the `(N+1+1)th Era`. That is to say, you can claim the rewards in the `(N+1+1+1)th Era`.
