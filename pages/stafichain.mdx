## Mainnet

### Introduction

StaFi Mainnet has successfully launched on 7th September 2020 12:00 UTC, the main functions of this version includes:

FIS Staking：FIS holders can participate in the NPoS consensus through staking and win staking rewards.

Token Transfer：Mainnet enables FIS transfer.

Token Vesting：Vesting app supports token vesting to StakingDrop Participants, Sitara Winner, Investor, etc.

Multi-signature：Account multi-signature is supportive, ready for StakingContracts.

Staking Contracts and rToken are not supportive in this version, those functions will be FULLY TESTED and AUDITED in Seiya and Sitara testnet, and then it will be upgraded to the Mainnet. Please note that, modules of Smart Contract and Staking Contract are removed, basic features are built with substrate and similar to Polkadot, thus no additional audit for this version.
