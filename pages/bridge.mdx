## Arbitrum Bridge

The Arbitrum bridge allows for seamless token transfers between the Ethereum mainnet and the Arbitrum Rollup chain. This guide will walk you through the process of bridging FIS and rETH tokens using the Arbitrum bridge.

<Steps>

### Connect to Ethereum Mainnet

Ensure your web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) is connected to the Ethereum mainnet.

### Visit the Arbitrum Bridge Portal

Navigate to the [official Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/).

### Initiate Transfer 

Click "Deposit" to begin the bridging process, which will lock your tokens on Ethereum and mint the equivalent on Arbitrum.

### Confirm Transaction

Confirm the transaction in your web3 wallet. Ensure you have enough ETH for gas fees.

### Switch to Arbitrum Network

In your web3 wallet, switch to the Arbitrum network to view and use your bridged tokens.

### Returning to Ethereum Mainnet 

To move tokens back to Ethereum, use the Arbitrum Bridge Portal, select the token, and initiate a withdrawal.

</Steps>

## Optimism Bridge

The Optimism bridge allows users to transfer tokens between the Ethereum mainnet and the Optimistic Ethereum (OE) network. This guide will walk you through the process of bridging FIS and rETH tokens using the Optimism bridge.

<Steps>

### Connect to Ethereum Mainnet

Ensure your web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) is connected to the Ethereum mainnet.

### Visit the Arbitrum Bridge Portal

Navigate to the official [Optimism Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit).

![StaFi Bridge](/image/bridge_11.png)

### Select Token

From the dropdown menu, select either FIS or rETH, depending on which token you want to bridge.

![StaFi Bridge](/image/bridge_12.png)

### Enter Amount 

Input the amount of FIS or rETH you wish to transfer to the Optimistic Ethereum network.

![StaFi Bridge](/image/bridge_13.png)

### Initiate Transfer 

Click on the "Deposit" or "Transfer" button. This will initiate the process of locking your tokens on the Ethereum mainnet and minting the equivalent amount on the OP network.

### Confirm Transaction

Confirm the transaction in your web3 wallet. Ensure you have enough ETH for gas fees.

### Wait for Completion 

The bridging process might take some time. Once completed, you'll receive the equivalent amount of FIS or rETH on the Optimistic Ethereum network.

### Switch to Optimistic Ethereum Network

In your web3 wallet, switch to the Optimistic Ethereum network to view and use your bridged FIS or rETH tokens.

</Steps>

## Polygon / Polygon zkEVM Bridge

The Polygon bridge facilitates token transfers between the Ethereum mainnet and the Polygon (Matic) network. This guide outlines the process of bridging FIS, rFIS, and rETH tokens using the Polygon bridge.

<Steps>

### Connect to Ethereum Mainnet

Ensure your web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) is connected to the Ethereum mainnet.

### Visit the Polygon Wallet

Navigate to the [official Polygon Wallet](https://wallet.polygon.technology/).

### Select Chain

Select to bridge either to Polygon or Polygon ZkEVM from the tabs shown.

### Select Token

Choose your preferred token, depending on which token you want to bridge.

![StaFi Bridge](/image/bridge_15.png)

### Enter Amount

Specify the amount of the selected token you wish to transfer to the Polygon network.

![StaFi Bridge](/image/bridge_16.png)

### Initiate Transfer

Click "Transfer" to start the bridging process, locking your tokens on Ethereum and minting the equivalent on Polygon.

### Confirm Transaction

Confirm the transaction in your web3 wallet. Ensure you have enough ETH for gas fees.

### Switch to Polygon Network

In your wallet, switch to the Polygon network to view and use your bridged tokens.
